# Zombied

**Zombied** is an educational space-themed game that turns physics practice into an engaging, interactive experience.  
Players launch a projectile through space, adjusting **speed** and **direction** to hit a **target planet** — learning key physics concepts like motion, velocity, and trajectory along the way.

## 🚀 Overview

In **Zombied**, you become a space explorer learning to master the laws of motion.  
Each level challenges you to calculate and input the right values to send your projectile to the target planet.  
The game responds dynamically based on your inputs — teaching through both **success** and **failure**.

- 🎯 **Goal:** Hit the target planet by setting correct speed and direction.  
- 📈 **Progression:** Each successful hit increases your **score** and **level**.  
- 💡 **Learning Focus:** Basic physics principles (motion, angles, and projectile dynamics).  
- 🌌 **Theme:** A fun, cosmic environment with colorful planets and space visuals.

## 🧩 Features

- 🌠 **Multiple Levels:** Increasing difficulty to match growing player skill.  
- ⚙️ **Interactive Input:** Players set initial velocity and direction.  
- 🪐 **Realistic Motion:** Projectiles travel through space according to real physics logic.  
- 📊 **Score System:** Earn points for every successful hit.  
- 🤖 **Learning Feedback:** When you miss, the game explains *why* — reinforcing understanding.  
- 🎨 **Engaging Visuals:** Space-themed design with moving planets and glowing effects.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Enter values** for your projectile’s speed and direction.  
2. Click **“Launch”** to fire the projectile through space.  
3. Watch how it moves — will it hit the planet or miss?  
4. If you **hit the target**, your score and level increase.  
5. If you **miss**, the game provides feedback to help you learn and try again.  

> 💡 *Tip:* Experiment with different values to see how changes affect your projectile’s path.

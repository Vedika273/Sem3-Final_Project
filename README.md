Our application is called Zombied. 

It’s an educational game where players launch a projectile through space and try to hit a 
target planet. To do this, they set the speed and direction of a projectile, practicing basic 
physics concepts along the way. 

Zombied has multiple levels and keeps score as players progress. After entering the values 
and clicking “Launch,” the projectile travels according to the player’s input. 

- If it reaches the planet, the score and level go up. 
- If it misses, the game explains why, helping players learn from the outcome.
  
With a space-themed background and planet targets, Zombied turns physics practice into 
an engaging simulation.
